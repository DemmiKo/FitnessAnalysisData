# FitnessAnalysisData
A script used to clean the data collected from smartphones while people conduct different activities.

The data has several files, describing what measurement belongs to what subject, which activity they were performing, and the associated measurments.

The script will bind together all the subject, activity, and measurement data into one tidy dataset. It has been filtered to only include the measurment variables that are either a mean or a standard deviation.
